<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>Shrek is a 2001 American computer-animated comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation and loosely based on William Steig's 1990 fairy tale picture book of the same name. Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson in their directorial debuts, it stars the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow. The film follows Shrek (Myers), a reclusive ogre who finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures who have been banished from the kingdom of Duloc by the corrupt Lord Farquaad (Lithgow).

Along the way, he rescues Princess Fiona (Diaz), who harbors a secret that complicates their journey.</p>
